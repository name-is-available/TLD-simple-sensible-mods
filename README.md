# The Long Dark - Simple Sensible Mods
You'll find here some small mods I've created to enhance the spirit of gameplay in The Long Dark.

Each feature is optional, all in a separate .modcomponent file.

**Alternative Torch Recipe:** Allows the creation of torches using cattail heads soaked in lantern fuel in lieu of more precious cloth. For playthroughs where torch pulling is forbidden (e.g. Fire Pack mod).

**Basic Leather:** Create leather from cured deer, moose, or wolf hides at the workbench. Requires simple or quality tools. Leather must be further cured for five days before use.

**Bone Broth:** Using bone fragments from harvested animal carcasses (added by Modders' Gear Toolbox), create the broth used in cooking by the TFTFT DLC.

# Installation
Please install the prerequisite [ModComponent](https://github.com/dommrogers/ModComponent), and if using bone broth, the [Modders' Gear Toolbox.](https://github.com/Jods-Its/Modders-Gear-Toolbox)

Drop the desired mod's .modcomponent file in The Long Dark/Mods directory.

If you've never installed mods before, please consult this mod list and [installation guide.](https://xpazeman.com/tld-mod-list/install.html)
